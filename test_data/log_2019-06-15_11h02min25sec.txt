Method(s) Setting(s)

  Combination strategy of considering an edge indirect.
	Threshold(in percentage) for minimum methods that suggest edge as indirect: 100.000000
	Threshold(in percentage) for minimum triplets that suggest edge as indirect: 1.000000

  Sign Pattern
	The interaction score is assumed to be in column 3

  Overlap
	The interaction length is assumed to be in column 8
	The interaction start of node X is assumed to be in column 6
	The interaction start of node Y is assumed to be in column 7
	Threshold of the overlap in percentage: 60.000000

  Interaction Information
	significance_level: 0.050000
	number of permutations: 100
	ENV-vector will be permuted and stored before examining the networks triplets.
	And in addition Joint Probabilities with them will be precomputed and also stored.

  Data Processing Inequality
	min mutual information(MI) threshold for MI comparison: 0.000000

  Interaction Information and Data Processing Inequality
	Threshold(in percentage) for maximum portion of 'nan' in vectors used for II and DPI: 20.000000


To compute the significance of the interaction information, we are randomizing the environmental abundance table with the seed: 94083199

Trackers:
5 ENVs are connected to at least one ID parameter.
424 of 424 ID-ENV edges are considered.
424 ID-ENV edges are within at least one triplet.
7 ENV-ENV edges.
